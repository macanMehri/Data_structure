With C# windows forms I developed this app which contains data structures such as 4list, two way circular lists, stack with lists and generalized lists.
The commands that can be used in this program are: 
For Lists:
1. Add new data to tail of the list.
2. Add new data to head of the list.
3. Deleting data from list.
4. Deleting multiples of a value in the list.
5. Sort the list.
6. Merge two sorted lists.
7. Print reverse.

For Stacks:
1. Push.
2. Pop.

For Generalized Lists:
1. Add new atomic node.
2. Add sublist.
3. Count Sum of datas.
4. Count average of datas.
5. Count number of datas.
6. Calculate depth of the list.
7. Transfer into circular list and sort it.
